# MoldTag

## Description

MoldTag is a handy Android application that offers a practical solution to a problem we often face in daily life. The application allows users to create a digital list where they can add and manage individual numbers instead of writing them on paper.

MoldTag, which I developed in order to increase the productivity of the employees of the company where I do my internship, will be very useful especially in business environments where frequent telephone contact or tracking of numbers is important.

## Features

- Easy to Use: Featuring a simple and intuitive interface, MoldTag makes it easy to add and manage numbers to the list.
- Search Feature: It offers a powerful search feature that allows you to quickly find added numbers.
- Android 9.0 Compatibility: The app is designed to be compatible with Android 9.0 and above.
- Efficient Solution: It offers a practical way to organise and manage numbers without the need for paper and pen.

## Usage Scenarios

- In business environments where telephone contact is established, it can be used for tracking customer or supplier numbers.
- For personal use, it can be used to keep frequently used numbers together and provide quick access.
- In group projects or team work, it can be used to store and share contact details of team members.
